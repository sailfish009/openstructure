Changes in Release 1.X.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Improved compare-structures action (chain mapping handling and documentation).
 * Improved handling of citations read from mmCIF files (mainly for books).
 * Several minor bug fixes and improvements.

Changes in Release 1.8.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Introduced recipes to generate Docker and Singularity images.
  * Moved "nonstandard" functions from ost.conop to ost.mol.alg. Mapping
    functions CopyResidue, CopyConserved and CopyNonConserved that were
    previousely imported from ost.conop are now to be imported from ost.mol.alg.
  * Removed habit of changing secondary structure of entities when loading
    from mmCIF PDB files. Before, OST would turn secondary structure 'EEH'
    into 'ECH' to make it look nicer in DNG. Now, 'EEH' stays 'EEH'.
  * Added Molck API to the ost.mol.alg module.
  * Extended lDDT API in ost.mol.alg module to reproduce functionality of lddt
    binary and fixed issues in stereo chemistry checks there.
  * Added `actions` interface including one action to compare structures.
  * Updated HHblits binding (minor changes for optional arguments).
  * Added functionality to find optimal membrane position of protein.
  * Support for recent compilers which use C++-11 by default.
  * Several minor bug fixes, improvements, and speed-ups.

Changes in Release 1.7.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fixed an issue that could cause the star format parser (mmCIF, chemical
    components dictionary) to enter an infinite loop
  * Chemical components dictionary was extended by new chemical classes
    introduced by PDB
  * Fixed unit tests
  * Improved documentation

Changes in Release 1.7.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    computation (Accessibility & AssignSecStruct in mol.alg)
  * Changed behaviour of mol.alg.Superpose with match = 'local-aln' or
    'global-aln' which used to fail for chains without peptide bonds (e.g.
    CA-only)
  * Large updates for documentation
  * Several minor bug fixes, improvements, and speed-ups

  * Flexible implementation of HBPlus
  * Updated dependencies (Eigen2 to Eigen3, Boost 1.47 to 1.53)

    functionality from within OST.

    hash)
  * Names of compounds are also stored in the compoundslib now
  * Added seq.ProfileHandle class and io.LoadSequenceProfile to work with 
    sequence profiles.
  * Added a wrapper to HHblits.
  * Removed levenberg_marquardt.h in img/alg

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Feasibility check set to off by default, atoms in compounds are now
    connected by the Builder irrespective of the distance between them
  * Speed improvement for bracketed within selections up to a factor of 20
  * refactored and streamlined the conop interface. The builder classes
    have been replaced by processors (HeuristicProcessor, RuleBasedProcessor)

Changes In Release 1.3.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * fix context menu/main menu for newer Qt versions 
  * CreateEntityFromView remembers chemical type (BZDNG-430)
  * fix gfx.PrimList.SetLineWidth
  * Fix remote=true for MMCIF loader (BZDNG-449)

Changes In Release 1.3.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    structure_analysis.py module.
  * Fix atom indices generated by CoordGroup::Filter()
  * small tweaks to lDDT output

  * Update directory layout of OST to be more conformant with the site-package
    system of Python: Instead of storing the modules in lib{64}/ost/ost, they
    are now in lib{64}/python{{VERSION}}/site-packages/ost
  * Added molck, the molecular checker. A small command-line tool to clean PDB 
    files, e.g. remove atoms with zero occupancy, "virtual atoms", hydrogens 
    etc.

Changes In Release 1.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * PDBWriter: Prevent writing of out-of-bounds atom coordinates.

Changes in Release 1.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Fixed loop indentation in the PDBize function for bio units, leading to
    exponential running time/ memory consumption. This problem only affected a
    fraction of PDB entries.

    [BZDNG-386]

    stddev.

Changes in Release 1.2.0 (since 1.1.0)

   default compiler and libraries

 * introducing the new table class, supporting all kinds of analyses on tabular
   data, including plotting and statistical analyses.

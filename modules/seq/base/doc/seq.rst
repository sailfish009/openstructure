:mod:`~ost.seq` -- Sequences and Alignments
================================================================================

.. module:: ost.seq
   :synopsis: Contains classes and functions to deal with sequences and 
              alignments

The :mod:`seq` module helps you working with sequence data of various kinds. It 
has classes for :class:`single sequences <SequenceHandle>`, :class:`lists of 
sequences <SequenceList>` and :class:`alignments <AlignmentHandle>` of two or
more sequences. 


.. _attaching-views:

Attaching Structures to Sequences
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As OpenStructure is a computational structural biology framework, it is not
surprising that the sequence classes have been designed to work together with
structural data. Each sequence can have an attached :class:`~ost.mol.EntityView`
allowing for fast mapping between residues in the entity view and position in
the sequence.

.. _sequence-offset:

Sequence Offset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using sequences and structures together, often the start of the structure 
and the beginning of the sequence do not fall together. In the following case, 
the alignment of sequences B and C only covers a subsequence of structure A::

  A acefghiklmnpqrstuvwy
  B     ghiklm
  C     123-45
  
We would now like to know which residue in protein A is aligned to which residue 
in sequence C. This is achieved by setting the sequence offset of sequence C to 
4. In essence, the sequence offset influences all the mapping operations from 
position in the sequence to residue index and vice versa. By default, the 
sequence offset is 0.

Loading and Saving Sequences and Alignments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :mod:`~ost.io` module supports input and output of common sequence formats.
Single  sequences can be loaded from disk with :func:`~ost.io.LoadSequence`,
alignments are loaded with :func:`~ost.io.LoadAlignment` and lists of sequences
are loaded with :func:`~ost.io.LoadSequenceList`. In addition to the file based
input  methods, sequences can also be loaded from a string:

.. code-block:: python

  seq_string = '''>sequence
  abcdefghiklmnop'''
  s = io.SequenceFromString(seq_string, 'fasta')
  print s.name, s # will print "sequence abcdefghiklmnop"
  
Note that, in that case specifying the format is mandatory.

The SequenceHandle
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: CreateSequence(name, sequence, role="UNKNOWN")

  Create a new :class:`SequenceHandle` with the given name and sequence. 

  :param name: Name of the sequence
  :type  name: :class:`str`
  :param sequence: String of characters representing the sequence. Only   
       'word' characters (no digits), '?', '-' and '.' are allowed. In an
       upcoming release, '?' and '.' will also be forbidden so its best to
       translate those to 'X' or '-'.
  :type sequence: :class:`str`
  :param role: Role of the sequence (optional)
  :type role:  :class:`str`
  :raises InvalidSequence: When the sequence string contains forbidden
       characters. In the future, '?' and '.' will also raise this exception.

.. class:: SequenceHandle
           ConstSequenceHandle

  Represents a sequence. New instances are created with :func:`CreateSequence`.
  
  .. method:: GetPos(residue_index)
  
    Get position of residue with index in sequence. This is best illustrated in 
    the following example:
    
    .. code-block:: python
      
      s=seq.CreateSequence("A", "abc---def")
      print s.GetPos(1) # prints 1
      print s.GetPos(3) # prints 6
    
    The reverse mapping, that is from position in the sequence to residue index 
    can be achieved with :meth:`GetResidueIndex`.
  
  .. method:: GetResidueIndex(pos)
     
    Get residue index of character at given position. This method is the
    inverse of :meth:`GetPos`. If the sequence contains a gap at that position,
    an :exc:`Error` is raised. Admires the
    :ref:`sequence offset <sequence-offset>`.
    
    .. code-block:: python
      
      s=seq.CreateSequence("A", "abc--def")
      print s.GetResidueIndex(1) # prints 1
      print s.GetResidueIndex(6) # prints 4
      # the following line raises an exception of type
      # Error with the message "requested position contains 
      # a gap"
      print s.GetResidueIndex(3)

  .. method:: GetResidue(pos)
     
    As, :meth:`GetResidueIndex`, but directly returns the residue view. If no
    view is attached, or if the position is a gap, an invalid residue view
    is returned.
    
    :rtype: :class:`~ost.mol.ResidueView`
    
  .. method:: GetLastNonGap()
     
    Get position of last non-gap character in sequence. In case of an empty
    sequence, or, a sequence only consisting of hyphens, -1 is returned
     
  .. method:: GetFirstNonGap()
  
    Get position of first non-gap character in sequence. In case of an empty
    sequence, or, a sequence only consisting of hyphens, -1 is returned.

  .. method:: AttachView(view)
              AttachView(view, chain_name)
    
    Attach an :class:`~mol.EntityView` to sequence. The first signature requires
    that the view contains one chain. If not, an :exc:`IntegrityError` is
    raised. The second signature will select the chain with the given name. If 
    no such chain exists, an :exc:`IntegrityError` is raised.
    
  .. method:: HasAttachedView()
  
    Returns True when the sequence has a view attached, False if not.
    
  .. method:: GetAttachedView()
  
    Returns the attached :class:`~mol.EntityView`, or an invalid
    :class:`~mol.EntityView` if no view has been attached. Also available as 
    the property :attr:`attached_view`.
    
  .. method:: GetName()
  
    Returns the name of the sequence. Also available as the property
    :attr:`name`
  
  .. method:: SetOffset()
  
    Set the :ref:`sequence offset <sequence-offset>`. By default, the offset is
    0. Also available as the property :attr:`offset`.
    
  .. method:: GetOffset()
    
    Returns the :ref:`sequence offset <sequence-offset>`. Also available as
    :attr:`offset`.
    
    
  .. method:: GetGaplessString()
     
    Returns a string version of this sequence with all hyphens removed. Also
    available as the property :attr:`gapless_string`.
     
  .. method:: Normalise()
     
    Remove '-' and '.' as gaps from the sequence and make it all upper case.
    Works in place.
   
  .. method:: SetName()
  
    Set name of the sequence. Also available as the property :attr:`name`.

  .. method:: GetOneLetterCode(pos)
              __getitem__(pos)
              __getitem__(slice)

    :return: Character at position *pos* of sequence (also supports pythonic
             slicing with [] operator)
    :rtype:  :class:`str`
  
  .. attribute:: gapless_string
     
    Shorthand for :meth:`GetGaplessString()`
     
  .. attribute:: name
  
    Shorthand for :meth:`GetName`/:meth:`SetName`
  
  .. attribute:: attached_view
  
    Shorthand for :meth:`GetAttachedView`.

  .. attribute:: offset
  
    Shorthand for :meth:`GetOffset`/:meth:`SetOffset`

  .. attribute:: role

    Role of this sequence.

    :type: :class:`str`

  .. method:: __len__()
    
    :return: The length of the sequence (including insertions and deletions)
    
  .. method:: __str__()

    :return: The sequence as a string.

  .. method:: Copy()
    
    Create a deep copy of the sequence. The newly created sequence has the same
    attached view (not a deep copy of the view!).

.. function:: SequenceFromChain(name, chain)

  :return: Sequence extracted from one letter codes in given *chain* with a
           view to the chain attached to it
  :rtype:  :class:`SequenceHandle`
  :param name: Name of the sequence
  :type  name: :class:`str`
  :param chain: Chain from which to extract sequence
  :type chain:  :class:`~ost.mol.ChainHandle` / :class:`~ost.mol.ChainView`

.. function:: Match(s1, s2)

  :param s1: The first sequence
  :param s2: The second sequence
  :type s1: :class:`SequenceHandle`, or :class:`str`
  :type s2: :class:`SequenceHandle`, or :class:`str`

  Check whether the two sequences s1 and s2 match. This function performs are
  case-insensitive comparison of the two sequences. The character  'X' is
  interpreted as a wild card character that always matches the other sequence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: CreateSequenceList()

  Creates and returns a new :class:`SequenceList` with no sequences.

.. class:: SequenceList
           ConstSequenceList

  Represents a list of sequences. The class provides a row-based interface.

  .. method:: GetCount()
              __len__()
  
    :return: Number of sequences in the list.
    :rtype:  :class:`int`

  .. method:: AddSequence(sequence)

    :return: *n* sequences starting from *first*.

  .. method:: __getitem__(key)

    :return: Access sequence(s) *key* (also supports pythonic slicing).


The AlignmentHandle
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :class:`AlignmentHandle` represents a list of aligned sequences. In
contrast to :class:`SequenceList`, an alignment requires all sequences to be of 
the same length. New instances of alignments are created with 
:func:`CreateAlignment` and :func:`AlignmentFromSequenceList`.

Typically sequence alignments are used column-based, i.e by looking at an  
aligned columns in the sequence alignment. To get a row-based (sequence) view
on the sequence list, use :meth:`~AlignmentHandle.GetSequences()`. 

All functions that operate on an alignment will again produce a valid alignment. 
This mean that it is not possible to change the length of one sequence, without  
adjusting the other sequences, too.

The following example shows how to iterate over the columns and sequences of
an alignment:

.. code-block:: python

  aln=io.LoadAlignment('aln.fasta')
  # iterate over the columns
  for col in aln:
    print col

  # iterate over the sequences
  for s in aln.sequences:
    print s

      # A fghik
      # B 67890

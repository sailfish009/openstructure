/// \brief Calculates conservation scores for each column in the alignment. 
/// 
/// The conservation score is a value between 0 and 1. The bigger the number 
/// the more conserved the aligned residues are. 
/// 
/// \p assign If true, the conservation scores are assigned to attached 
///     residues. The name of the property can be changed with the prop_name 
///     parameter. Useful when coloring entities based on sequence conservation.
/// \p prop_name The property name for assigning the conservation to 
///     attached residues. Defaults to 'cons'.
/// \p ignore_gap If true, the dissimilarity between two gaps is increased to
///     6.0 instead of 0.5 as defined in the original version. Without this, a
///     stretch where in the alignment there is only one sequence which is
///     aligned to only gaps, is considered highly conserved (depending on the
///     number of gap sequences).

Linear Database
===============================================================================

.. currentmodule:: ost.db


Many applications require to load lots of structures. Expecially on distributed
file systems, io becomes a problem.
OST provides a linear database to dump position data, e.g. CA positions, or 
character data, e.g. sequences, to allow fast retrieval.
The actual data container behave like linear data arrays and the idea is to
use an indexer to keep track of where to find data for a certain entry.

.. class:: LinearIndexer()

  The idea of the :class:`LinearIndexer` is to keep track of locations
  of data assuming a linear memory layout. The level of entries in the indexer
  are assemblies that can contain an arbitrary number of chains with varying
  length. Whenever a new assembly is added, a range enclosing all residues of
  that assembly is defined that is subsequent to the range of the previously
  added assembly. It is then not only possible to access the range of the full
  assembly, but also the range of single chains. 
  Whenever an assembly with *n* residues is deleted, the ranges of all 
  assemblies that have been added later on are reduced by *n*.

  .. method:: Load(filename)

    :raises:            :exc:`ost.Error` if *filename* cannot be
                        opened


  .. method:: Save(filename)

    :type filename:     :class:`str`
    :raises:            :exc:`ost.Error` if *filename* cannot be       
                        created


  .. method:: AddAssembly(name, chain_names, chain_lenths)

    Adds a new assembly to the indexer. The range assigned to that assembly is 
    subsequent to the previously added assembly.

                        *chain_names* and *chain_lengths* is inconsistent


  .. method:: RemoveAssembly(name)

    Removes an assembly from the indexer. Assuming that assembly contains
    a total of *n* residues, all ranges of the subsequent assemblies are
    reduced by *n*.

.. class:: LinearCharacterContainer()

  The :class:`LinearCharacterContainer` stores characters in a linear memory 
  layout that can represent sequences such as SEQRES or ATOMSEQ. 
  It can be accessed using range parameters and the idea is to keep it in sync 
  with a :class:`LinearIndexer`.

  .. method:: Load(filename)

    Loads container from file

    :param filename:    Path to file to be loaded
    :type filename:     :class:`str`
    :returns:           The loaded container
    :rtype:             :class:`LinearCharacterContainer`

                        created

  .. method:: AddCharacters(characters)

    Adds *characters* at the end of the internal data. Call this function with
    appropriate data whenever you add an assembly to the associated
    :class:`LinearIndexer`

    :param characters:  Characters to be added
    :type characters:   :class:`str`


  .. method:: ClearRange(range)

    Removes all characters specified by *range* in form [*from*, *to* [ 
    from the internal data. 
    The internal data layout is linear, all characters starting from *to*
    are shifted to the location defined by *from*.
    Call this function with appropriate range whenever you remove an assembly
    from the associated :class:`LinearIndexer`

    :param range:       Range to be deleted in form [from, to[
    :type range:        :class:`tuple` of :class:`int`

    :rypte:             :class:`int`
   


.. class:: LinearPositionContainer()

  The :class:`LinearPositionContainer` stores positions in a linear memory 
  layout. 
  It can be accessed using range parameters and the idea is to keep it in sync 
  with a :class:`LinearIndexer`. In order to save some memory, a lossy 
  compression is applied that results in a limited accuracy of two digits.
  if the absolute value of your added position is very large (> ~10000),
  the accuracy is further lowered to one digit. This is all handled internally.

  .. method:: Load(filename)

    Adds *positions* at the end of the internal data. Call this function with
    appropriate data whenever you add an assembly to the associated
    :class:`LinearIndexer`

    :param positions:   Positions to be added
    :type positions:    :class:`ost.geom.Vec3List`

    Call this function with appropriate range whenever you remove an assembly
    from the associated :class:`LinearIndexer`

    :param range:       Range to be deleted in form [from, to[

    the function requires the position to be passed as reference.

    :param idx:         Specifies location

    Extracts positions at specified range. For efficiency reasons, the function
    requires the positions to be passed as reference.

Data Extraction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Openstructure provides data extraction functionality for the following scenario:
There is a SEQRES container and an ATOMSEQ container 
(both: :class:`LinearCharacterContainer`).
Positions are stored in :class:`LinearPositionContainer`. 
The containers contain entries from the protein structure database
and sequence/position data is relative to the SEQRES of those entries. 
This means, if the SEQRES has more characters as there are resolved residues
in the structure, the entry in the position container(s) still contains the exact
number of SEQRES characters but some positions remain invalid. Thats where the
ATOMSEQ container comes in. It only contains matching residues to the SEQRES but
marks non-resolved residues with '-'. 

.. method:: ExtractValidPositions(entry_name, chain_name, indexer, \
                                  atomseq_container, position_container, \
                                  seq, positions)

  Iterates over all data for a chain specified by *entry_name* and *chain_name*.
  For every data point marked as valid in the *atomseq_container* (character at
  that position is not '-'), the character and the corresponding position are 
  added to *seq* and *positions*

  :param entry_name:    Name of assembly you want the data from
  :param chain_name:    Name of chain you want the data from
  :param indexer:       Used to access *atomseq_container* and 
                        *position_container*
  :param atomseq_container: Container that marks locations with invalid position
                            data with '-'
  :param position_container: Container containing position data
  :param seq:           Sequence with extracted valid positions gets stored
                        in here.
  :param positions:     The extracted valid positions get stored in here

                                position_container)

  Let's say we have a target-template alignment in *aln* (first seq: target, 
  second seq: template). This function extracts all valid template positions 
  given the entry specified by *entry_name* and *chain_name*. The template
  sequence in *aln* must match the sequence in *seqres_container*. Again,
  the *atomseq_container* is used to identify valid positions. The according
  residue numbers relative to the target sequence in *aln* are also returned.

  :param entry_name:    Name of assembly you want the data from
  :param chain_name:    Name of chain you want the data from
  :param aln:           Target-template sequence alignment
  :param indexer:       Used to access *atomseq_container*, *seqres_container* 
                        and *position_container*
  :param seqres_container:  Container containing the full sequence data
  :param atomseq_container: Container that marks locations with invalid position
                            data with '-'
  :param position_container: Container containing position data

                        relate each entry in the second element to the target 
                        sequence specified in  *aln*. The numbering scheme 
                        starts from one. Second Element: the according positions.

  :rtype:               :class:`tuple`

  :raises:              :exc:`ost.Error` if requested data is not present in 
                        the container or if the template sequence in *aln*
                        doesn't match with the sequence in *seqres_container*

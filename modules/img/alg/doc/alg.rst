Applying algorithms
-------------------

While image properties are usually manipulated using method of the :class:`~ost.img.ImageHandle` class, their data content
is manipulated using image algorithms. Image algorithms are objects. Each of them is a class, and its methods are used to handle the algorithm parameters. Applying an algorithm to an image is then conceptually a two-step process. First, an instance of an algorithm class is created, yielding an algorithm object. In a second step, the algorithm object is applied to an image. An algorithm can be applied in-place (using the :meth:`~ßost.img.ImageHandle.Apply` method), modifying the image. or out-of-place, (using :meth:`~ost.img.ImageHandle.ApplyIP` ), leaving the original image untouched, and returning the result as a new image. 

Here is an example. All the algorithms used in the following are described in the :ref:`algorithms` section.

.. code-block:: python
 
  # creates an algorithm object
  rand_alg = img.alg.Randomize() 
  # applies algorithm object in place, overwriting the image
  im.ApplyIP( rand_alg )

Sometimes, there is no need to create a permanent instance of an algorithm object. A temporary object enough:

.. code-block:: python

  # applies temporary algorithm object in-place
  im.ApplyIP( img.alg.GaussianFilter(4.0) )

When used this way, the algorithm class will cease to exist as soon as the algorithm is applied. However, some algorithm are stateful and store information. One good example is the Stat algorithm, which does not modify the image when applied, but change its internal state to store information extracted from the image, which can be recovered later. For example:

.. code-block:: python

  # creates and applies an algorithm object
  stat=img.alg.Stat()
  im.ApplyIP(stat)
  # extracts information from the algorithm
  mean=stat.GetMean()

It is important to remember that when the algorithms ceases to exist, all information it stores is lost.

Fourier Transforming Images
----------------------------

An image can be Fourier-transformed using either the FFT algorithm or the DFT algorithm. The difference between the two is that the DFT algorithm honors the :ref:`spatial-origin` of the image, and applies the corresponding phase shift in Fourier space. The FFT does not follow this behavior. 

.. code-block:: python

  # create an instance of the Dft algorithm object
  dft=img.alg.DFT() 
  # do the actual Fourier transformation
  im_ft=im.Apply(dft) 
  # back-transform
  im2 = im_ft.Apply(dft) 

The FFT and DFT algorithms do not require a direction to be given (forward or back transform). This is implicitly determined by the current :ref:`data-domain` of the image being transformed. The following rules apply. 

* SPATIAL -> HALF_FREQUENCY
* HALF_FREQUENCY -> SPATIAL
* FREQUENCY -> COMPLEX_SPATIAL
* COMPLEX_SPATIAL -> FREQUENCY

Filters
-------

OpenStructure makes several image filters available. Most of them are Fourier space filters, others are real space ones.
However, since the :class:`ost.img.ImagerHandle` class is aware of its own :ref:`data-domain`, the user does not need to
convert the image to Fourier space or to real space. Irrespective of which domain the filter applies to, OpenStructure 
will internally convert the image to the appropriate domain, apply the filter, and then return the image to its original 
conditions.

The following filters are available (their are described in the :ref:`algorithms` section below)

Fourier space filters:

* :class:`LowPassFilter`
* :class:`HighPassFilter`
* :class:`GaussianLowPassFilter`
* :class:`GaussianHighPassFilter`
* :class:`FermiLowPassFilter`
* :class:`FermiHighPassFilter`
* :class:`ButterworthLowPassFilter`
* :class:`ButterworthHighPassFilter`
* :class:`FermiLowPassFilter`

Real space filters:

* :class:`GaussianFilter`

Selected Algorithms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many algorithms are available for image manipulation. What follows is a description of the 
most important ones.

.. class:: DFT()

   This algorithm performs a Fourier Transform of the image, honoring its :ref:`spatial-origin`, thus
   applying the corresponding phase shift in Fourier space.

.. class:: DiscreteShrink(block_size)

   The algorithm performs a scaling of the original image by merging adjacent 
   blocks of pixels. The block size is passed in the constructor in the form of a :class:`~ost.img.Size`
   but can be changed later using the relevant method. The :class:`~ost.img.Size` and the :class:`~ost.img.Extent` 
   of the image are changed when the algorithm is applied. The :ref:`pixel-sampling` of the image is also adjusted 
   according to the scaling, so that the size of the image in the absolute reference system used by
   OpenStructure stays constant.

  Provides low-level skeleton link connectivity

  xi denotes rotation around a link, which will only affect the
  consecutive ones, ie the direction normal. In a molecular structure
  xi denotes a torsion angle.

  omega and xi denote orientation relativ to the current transformation,
  which has a main axis direction and a normal vector. If the main axis
  is along z, and the normal vector along x, omega describes the angle
  of the link with the z-axis, and xi the angle of the projected link
  in the xy plane to the x-axis.

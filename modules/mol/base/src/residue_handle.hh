/// \brief  Residue handle
/// 
/// In a polymer a residue is a single unit such as a nucleotide or an amino
/// acid. In case of ligands, a residue ofter represents a completye molecule, 
/// such as a HEM group.
///
/// Every residue belongs to a \ref ChainHandle "chain" and has a defined 
/// position (#GetIndex) in that chain. In a peptide chain, the previous (towards 
/// N-terminus) and next (towards C-terminus) can be obtained with GetPrev() and
/// GetNext() respectively.
///
/// A residue consist of one or more \ref AtomHandle "atoms". The list of atoms
/// can be retrieved with #GetAtomList(), wheras #FindAtom() will locate a
/// particular atom in the residue.
/// 
/// To add atoms to the residue, you have to request an editor and call
/// EditorBase::InsertAtom() or EditorBase::InsertAltAtom()
/// 
/// \code
/// XCSEditor edi=residue.GetEntity().EditXCS();
/// edi.InsertAtom(residue, "CA", geom.Vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0));

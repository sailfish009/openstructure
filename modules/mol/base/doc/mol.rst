================================================================================

.. module:: ost.mol
   :synopsis: Contains classes and functions to deal with molecular structures
              and surfaces

The mol module implements data structures to work with molecular datasets. At its heart lie the :class:`EntityHandle` and :class:`EntityView` classes which represent molecular structures such as proteins, DNA, RNA and small molecules. There are also classes to deal with molecular surfaces.

/// \brief Calculates the Distance RMSD in a model, given a list of distances with their refence length
///
/// Calculates the two values needed to determine the Distance RMSD Test score for a given model, i.e.
/// the sum of the squared distance deviations and the total number of distances on which the sum was
/// calculated. 
/// The function requires a list of distances for which the distance deviation has to be computed, together 
/// with a reference length for each of them. The function also requires a model on which the returned
/// values are computed. Furthermore, the function requires a default deviation value to be used in the 
/// calculations when a distance is not present in the model.
///
/// The distance information needs to be stored in ian instance of the GlobalRDMap object. This object
/// stores two distance lengths for each distance. This function uses the first of them as reference length 
/// and ignores the second. 
/// 
/// The function only processes standard residues in the first chains of the model and of the reference
/// For residues with symmetric sidechains (GLU, ASP, ARG, VAL, PHE, TYR), the 
/// naming of the atoms is ambigous. For these residues, the function computes the Distance RMSD 
/// score that each naming convention would generate when considering all non-ambigous surrounding atoms.
/// The solution that gives lower score is then picked to compute the final Distance RMSD score for the whole 
/// model.
///
/// A sequence separation parameter can be passed to the function. If this happens, only distances between residues
/// whose separation is higher than the provided parameter are considered when computing the score. 
///
/// If a string is provided as an argument to the function, residue-per-residue statistics are stored as 
/// residue properties. Specifically, the local residue-based Distance RMSD score is stored in a float property 
/// as the provided string, while the residue-based sum of squared distances and the number of distances checked 
/// are saved in two properties named <string>_sum (a float property) and <string>_count (an int property).

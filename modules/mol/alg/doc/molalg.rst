Local Distance Test scores (lDDT, DRMSD)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: LocalDistDiffTest(model, distance_list, tolerance_list, \
                                sequence_separation=0, \
                                local_lddt_property_string="")
  
  This function counts the number of conserved local contacts between a model
  and a reference structure which is needed to compute the Local Distance
  Difference Test score.

  The Local Distance Difference Test score is a number between zero and one,
  which measures the agreement of  local contacts between a model and a
  reference structure. One means complete agreement, and zero means no agreement
  at all. The calculation of this score does not require any superposition
  between the model and the reference structures.
  
  All distances between atoms in the reference structure that are shorter than a
  certain predefined length (inclusion radius) are compared with the
  corresponding distances in the model structure. If the difference between a
  reference distance and the corresponding model distance is smaller than a
  threshold value (tolerance), that distance is considered conserved. The final
  lDDT score is the fraction of conserved distances. Missing atoms in the model
  structure lead to non-conserved distances (and thus lower the final lDDT
  score).
  
  This function takes as an input a list of distances to be checked for
  conservation. Any number of threshold values  can be specified when the
  function is called. All thresholds are then applied in sequence and the return
  counts are averaged over all threshold values. A sequence separation parameter
  can be passed to the function. If this happens, only distances between
  residues whose separation in sequence is higher than the provided parameter
  are considered when the score is computed.

  If a string is passed as the last parameter, residue-based counts and the
  value of the residue-based Local Distance Difference Test score are saved in
  each ResidueHandle as int and float properties. Specifically, the local
  residue-based lddt score is stored in a float property named as the provided
  string, while the residue-based number of conserved and total distances are
  saved in two int properties named <string>_conserved and <string>_total.

.. function:: LocalDistDiffTest(model, target, cutoff, max_dist, \

.. function:: LocalDistDiffTest(alignment, tolerance, radius, ref_index=0, \
                                mdl_index=1)

  Calculates the Local Distance Difference Test score (see previous function)
  starting from an alignment between a reference structure and a model. The
  AlignmentHandle parameter used to provide the  alignment to the function needs
  to have the two structures attached to it. By default the first structure in
  the alignment is considered to be the reference structure, and the second
  structure is taken as the model. This can however be changed by passing the
  indexes of the two structures in the AlignmentHandle as parameters to the
  function.

  .. note::

    This function uses the old implementation of the Local Distance Difference
    Test algorithm and will give slightly different results from the new one.

  :param alignment: an alignment containing the sequences of the reference and
                    of the model structures, with the structures themselves
                    attached
  :type alignment:  :class:`~ost.seq.AlignmentHandle`
  :param tolerance: a list of thresholds used to determine distance conservation
  :param radius: the inclusion radius in Angstroms (to determine which distances
                 are checked for conservation)
  :param ref_index: index of the reference structure in the alignment 
  :param mdl_index: index of the model in the alignment

  :returns: the Local Distance Difference Test score


.. function:: LDDTHA(model, distance_list, sequence_separation=0)

  This function calculates the Local Distance Difference Test, using the same
  threshold values as the GDT-HA test (the default set of thresholds used for
  the lDDT score) (See previous functions). The thresholds are 0.5, 1, 2, and 4
  Angstroms.

  The function only compares the input distance list to the first chain of the
  model structure.

  The local residue-based lDDT score values are stored in the ResidueHandles of
  the model passed to the function in a float property called "locallddt".

  A sequence separation parameter can be passed to the function. If this
  happens, only distances between residues whose separation is higher than the
  provided parameter are considered when computing the score.

  :param model: the model structure
  :type model:  :class:`~ost.mol.EntityView`
  :param distance_list: the list of distances to check for conservation
  :type distance_list:  :class:`~ost.mol.alg.GlobalRDMap`
  :param sequence_separation: sequence separation parameter

  :returns: the Local Distance Difference Test score


.. function:: DistanceRMSDTest(model, distance_list, cap_difference, \
                               sequence_separation=0, \
                               local_drmsd_property_string="")
  
  This function performs a Distance RMSD Test on a provided model, and
  calculates the two values that are necessary to determine the Distance RMSD
  Score, namely the sum of squared distance deviations and the number of
  distances on which the sum was computed.

  The Distance RMSD Test (or DRMSD Test) computes the deviation in the length of
  local contacts between a model and a reference structure and expresses it in
  the form of a score value. The score has an an RMSD-like form, with the
  deviations in the RMSD formula computed as contact distance differences. The
  score is open-ended, with a value of zero meaning complete agreement of local
  contact distances, and a positive value revealing a disagreement of magnitude
  proportional to the score value itself. This score does not require any
  superposition between the model and the reference.
  
  This function processes a list of distances provided by the user, together
  with their length in the reference structure. For each distance that is found
  in the model, its difference with the reference length is computed and used as
  deviation term in the RMSD-like formula.When a distance is not present in the
  model because one or both the atoms are missing, a default deviation value
  provided by the user is used.

  The function only processes distances between atoms that do not belong to the
  same residue, and considers only standard residues in the first chain of the
  model. For residues with symmetric sidechains (GLU, ASP, ARG, VAL, PHE, TYR),
  the naming of the atoms is ambiguous. For these residues, the function
  computes the Distance RMSD Test score that each naming convention would
  generate when considering all non-ambiguous surrounding atoms. The solution
  that gives the lower score is then picked to compute the final Distance RMSD
  Score for the whole model.
  
  A sequence separation parameter can be passed to the function. If this
  happens, only distances between residues whose separation is higher than the
  provided parameter are considered when computing the score.

  If a string is passed as last parameter to the function, the function computes
  the Distance RMSD Score for each residue and saves it as a float property in
  the ResidueHandle, with the passed string as property name. Additionally, the
  actual sum of squared deviations and the number of distances on which it was
  computed are stored as properties in the ResidueHandle. The property names are
  respectively <passed string>_sum (a float property) and <passed string>_count
  (an integer property).

  :param model: the model structure
  :type model:  :class:`~ost.mol.EntityView`
  :param distance_list: the list of distances to check (here we only use the
                        first of the two distance values stored, the second
                        is ignored)
  :type distance_list:  :class:`~ost.mol.alg.GlobalRDMap`
  :param cap_difference: a default deviation value to be used when a distance is
                         not found in the model
  :param sequence_separation: sequence separation parameter
  :param local_ldt_property_string: the base name for the ResidueHandle
                                    properties that store the local scores

  :returns: a tuple containing the sum of squared distance deviations, and the
            number of distances on which it was computed.


.. function:: DRMSD(model, distance_list, cap_difference, sequence_separation=0)

  This function calculates the Distance RMSD Test score (see
  :func:`DistanceRMSDTest`).
  
  The function only considers distances between atoms not belonging to the same
  residue, and only compares the input distance list to the first chain of the
  model structure. It requires, in addition to the model and the list
  themselves, a default deviation value to be used in the DRMSD Test when a
  distance is not found in the model.

  The local Local Distance Difference Test score values are stored in the
  ResidueHandles of the model passed to the function in a float property called
  "localdrmsd".

  A sequence separation parameter can be passed to the function. If this
  happens, only distances between residues whose separation is higher than the
  provided parameter are considered when computing the score.

  :param model: the model structure
  :type model:  :class:`~ost.mol.EntityView`
  :param distance_list: the list of distances as in :func:`DistanceRMSDTest`
  :type distance_list: :class:`~ost.mol.alg.GlobalRDMap`
  :param cap_difference: a default deviation value to be used when a distance is
                         not found in the model
  :param sequence_separation: sequence separation parameter
  :returns: the Distance RMSD Test score


.. function:: CreateDistanceList(reference, radius)
              CreateDistanceListFromMultipleReferences(reference_list, \
                                                       tolerance_list, \
                                                       sequence_separation, \
                                                       radius)

  Both these functions create lists of distances to be checked during a Local
  Distance Difference Test (see description of the functions above).

  .. note::

    These functions process only standard residues present in the first chain of
    the reference structures.

  The only difference between the two functions is that one takes a single
  reference structure and the other a list of reference structures. The
  structures in the list have to be properly prepared before being passed to the
  function. Corresponding residues in the structures must have the same residue
  number, the same chain name, etc. Gaps are allowed and automatically dealt
  with: if information about a distance is present in at least one of the
  structures, it will be considered.

  If a distance between two atoms is shorter than the inclusion radius in all
  structures in which the two atoms are present, it is included in the list.
  However, if the distance is longer than the inclusion radius in at least one
  of the structures, it is not considered to be a local interaction and is
  excluded from the list.

  The multiple-reference function takes care of residues with ambiguous
  symmetric sidechains. To decide which naming convention to use, the function
  computes a Local Distance Difference Test score foreach reference against the
  first reference structure in the list, using only non ambiguously-named atoms.
  It picks then the naming convention that gives the highest score, guaranteeing
  that all references are processed with the correct atom names.

  The cutoff list that will later be used to compute the Local Distance
  Difference Test score and the sequence separation parameter must be passed to
  the multi-reference function. These parameters do not influence the output
  distance list, which always includes all distances within the provided radius
  (to make it consistent with the single-reference corresponding function).
  However, the parameters are used when dealing with the naming convention of
  residues with ambiguous nomenclature.

.. _steric-clashes:

Steric Clashes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following function detects steric clashes in atomic structures. Two atoms are clashing if their euclidian distance is smaller than a threshold value (minus a tolerance offset). 


.. function:: FilterClashes(entity, clashing_distances, always_remove_bb=False)

  This function filters out residues with non-bonded clashing atoms. If the
  clashing atom is a backbone atom, the complete residue is removed from the
  structure, if the atom is part of the sidechain, only the sidechain atoms are
  removed. This behavior is changed  by the *always_remove_bb* flag: when the
  flag is set to True the whole residue is removed even if a clash is just
  detected in the side-chain.

  The function returns a view containing all elements (residues, atoms) that
  have not been removed from the input structure, plus a
  :class:`~ost.mol.alg.ClashingInfo` object containing information about the
  detected clashes.
  
  Two atoms are defined as clashing if their distance is shorter than the
  reference distance minus a tolerance threshold. The information about the
  clashing distances and the tolerance thresholds for all possible pairs of
  atoms is passed to the function as a parameter.

  Hydrogen and deuterium atoms are ignored by this function.
  
  :param entity: The input entity
  :type entity: :class:`~ost.mol.EntityView` or :class:`~ost.mol.EntityHandle`
  :param clashing_distances: information about the clashing distances
  :type clashing_distances: :class:`~ost.mol.alg.ClashingDistances`
  :param always_remove_bb: if set to True, the whole residue is removed even if
                           the clash happens in the side-chain
  :type always_remove_bb:  :class:`bool`

  :returns: A tuple of two elements: The filtered :class:`~ost.mol.EntityView`,
            and a :class:`~ost.mol.alg.ClashingInfo` object


.. function:: CheckStereoChemistry(entity, bond_stats, angle_stats, \

                                   always_remove_bb=False)

  This function filters out residues with severe stereo-chemical violations. If
  the violation involves a backbone atom, the complete residue is removed from
  the structure, if it involves an atom that is part of the sidechain, only the
  sidechain is removed. This behavior is changed  by the *always_remove_bb*
  flag: when the flag is set to True the whole residue is removed even if a
  violation is just detected in the side-chain.

  The function returns a view containing all elements (residues, atoms) that
  have not been removed from the input structure, plus a
  :class:`~ost.mol.alg.StereoChemistryInfo` object containing information about
  the detected stereo-chemical violations.
    
  A violation is defined as a bond length that lies outside of the range:
  [mean_length-std_dev*bond_tolerance, mean_length+std_dev*bond_tolerance] or an
  angle width outside of the range [mean_width-std_dev*angle_tolerance,
  mean_width+std_dev*angle_tolerance ]. The information about the mean lengths
  and widths and the corresponding standard deviations is passed to the function
  using two parameters.

  Hydrogen and deuterium atoms are ignored by this function.

  :param entity: The input entity
  :type entity: :class:`~ost.mol.EntityView` or :class:`~ost.mol.EntityHandle`
  :param bond_stats: statistics about bond lengths
  :type bond_stats: :class:`~ost.mol.alg.StereoChemicalParams`

  Calculates the accesssible surface area for ever atom in *ent*. The algorithm

                        every residue with name "HOH" is neglected.
  :type include_water:  :class:`bool`

  :param oligo_mode:    A typical used case of accessibility calculations is to 
                        determine the solvent accessibility of a full complex
                        and then the accessibility of each chain individually.
                        Lots of calculations can be cached because only the 
                        values of the atoms close to an interface change.
                        This is exactly what happens when you activate the 
                        oligo mode. It returns exactly the same value but adds,
                        additionally to the values estimated in full complex, 
                        the values from each individual chain as float

                        to "asaAtom": Accessibility in the full complex is 
                        stored as "asaAtom", the accessibility when only 
                        considering that particular chain is stored as

  :param asa_rel:       Float property name to assign the relative solvent

                        accessibility of that particular residue. 
                        This maximum solvent accessibility is dependent on
                        the chosen :class:`AccessibilityAlgorithm`.

.. class:: FindMemParam

  Result object for the membrane detection algorithm described below

  .. attribute:: axis

    initial search axis from which optimal membrane slab could be found

  .. attribute:: tilt_axis

    Axis around which we tilt the membrane starting from the initial axis

  .. attribute:: tilt

    Angle to tilt around tilt axis

  .. attribute:: angle

    After the tilt operation we perform a rotation around the initial axis
    with this angle to get the final membrane axis

  .. attribute:: membrane_axis

    The result of applying the tilt and rotation procedure described above.
    The membrane_axis is orthogonal to the membrane plane and has unit length.

  .. attribute:: pos

    Real number that describes the membrane center point. To get the actual
    position you can do: pos * membrane_axis

  .. attribute:: width

    Total width of the membrane in A

  .. attribute:: energy

    Pseudo energy of the implicit solvation model

  .. attribute:: membrane_representation

    Dummy atoms that represent the membrane. This entity is only valid if
    the according flag has been set to True when calling FindMembrane.


.. method:: FindMembrane(ent, assign_membrane_representation=True, fast=False)

  Estimates the optimal membrane position of a protein by using an implicit 
  solvation model. The original algorithm and the used energy function are 
  described in: Lomize AL, Pogozheva ID, Lomize MA, Mosberg HI (2006) 
  Positioning of proteins in membranes: A computational approach.

  There are some modifications in this implementation and the procedure is
  as follows:

  * Initial axis are constructed that build the starting point for initial 
    parameter grid searches.

  * For every axis, the protein is rotated so that the axis builds the z-axis

    * In order to exclude internal hydrophilic pores, only the outermost atoms
      with respect the the z-axis enter an initial grid search
    * The width and position of the membrane is optimized for different 
      combinations of tilt and rotation angles (further described in
      :class:`FindMemParam`). The top 20 parametrizations 
      (only top parametrization if *fast* is True) are stored for further 
      processing.

  * The 20 best membrane parametrizations from the initial grid search 
    (only the best if *fast* is set to True) enter a final 
    minimization step using a Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer. 


  :param ent:           Entity of a transmembrane protein, you'll get weird 
                        results if this is not the case. The energy term

                        the parametrization with optimal minimized energy is 
                        returned. 
                        If set to yes, only the best result of the initial grid
                        search is selected and returned after

.. _traj-analysis:

Trajectory Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of functions used for basic trajectory analysis such as extracting
positions, distances, angles and RMSDs. The organization is such that most
functions have their counterpart at the individual :class:`frame level

Mapping functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. currentmodule:: ost.mol.alg

The following functions help to convert one residue into another by reusing as
much as possible from the present atoms. They are mainly meant to map from
standard amino acid to other standard amino acids or from modified amino acids
to standard amino acids.

.. function:: CopyResidue(src_res, dst_res, editor)

  Copies the atoms of ``src_res`` to ``dst_res`` using the residue names
  as guide to decide which of the atoms should be copied. If ``src_res`` and
  ``dst_res`` have the same name, or ``src_res`` is a modified version of
  ``dst_res`` (i.e. have the same single letter code), :func:`CopyConserved`
  will be called, otherwise :func:`CopyNonConserved`.

  If a CBeta atom wasn't already copied from ``src_res``, a new one at a
  reconstructed position will be added to ``dst_res`` if it is not ``GLY`` and
  all backbone positions are available to do it.

  :param src_res: The source residue
  :type src_res: :class:`~ost.mol.ResidueHandle`
  :param dst_res: The destination residue (expected to be a standard amino acid)
  :type dst_res: :class:`~ost.mol.ResidueHandle`
  :param editor: Editor used to modify *dst_res*.
  :type editor: :class:`~ost.mol.XCSEditor`

  :returns: True if the residue could be copied as a conserved residue,
            False if it had to fallback to :func:`CopyNonConserved`.

.. function:: CopyConserved(src_res, dst_res, editor)

  Copies the atoms of ``src_res`` to ``dst_res`` assuming that the parent
  amino acid of ``src_res`` (or ``src_res`` itself) are identical to ``dst_res``.

  If ``src_res`` and ``dst_res`` are identical, all heavy atoms are copied
  to ``dst_res``. If ``src_res`` is a modified version of ``dst_res`` and the
  modification is a pure addition (e.g. the phosphate group of phosphoserine),
  the modification is stripped off and all other heavy atoms are copied to
  ``dst_res``. If the modification is not a pure addition, it falls back to
  :func:`CopyNonConserved`.

  Additionally, the selenium atom of ``MSE`` is converted to sulphur to map
  ``MSE`` to ``MET``.

  :param src_res: The source residue
  :type src_res: :class:`~ost.mol.ResidueHandle`
  :param dst_res: The destination residue (expected to be a standard amino acid)
  :type dst_res: :class:`~ost.mol.ResidueHandle`
  :param editor: Editor used to modify *dst_res*.
  :type editor: :class:`~ost.mol.XCSEditor`

  :returns: A tuple of bools stating whether the residue could be copied without
            falling back to :func:`CopyNonConserved` and whether the CBeta atom
            was copied from ``src_res`` to ``dst_res``.

.. function:: CopyNonConserved(src_res, dst_res, editor)

  Copies the heavy backbone atoms and CBeta (except for ``GLY``) of ``src_res``
  to ``dst_res``.

  :param src_res: The source residue
  :type src_res: :class:`~ost.mol.ResidueHandle`
  :param dst_res: The destination residue (expected to be a standard amino acid)
  :type dst_res: :class:`~ost.mol.ResidueHandle`
  :param editor: Editor used to modify *dst_res*.
  :type editor: :class:`~ost.mol.XCSEditor`

  :returns: A tuple of bools as in :func:`CopyConserved` with the first bool
            always being False.

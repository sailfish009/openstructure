  Requirements for use:

  - A default :class:`compound library <ost.conop.CompoundLib>` must be defined
    and accessible via :func:`~ost.conop.GetDefaultLib`. This is set by default
    when executing scripts with ``ost``. Otherwise, you must set this with

  - ClustalW must be installed (unless you provide chain mappings)

    # load two biounits to compare
    ent_full = ost.io.LoadPDB('3ia3', remote=True)

  For maximal performance when computing QS scores of the same entity with many
  others, it is advisable to construct and reuse :class:`QSscoreEntity` objects.

  Any known / precomputed information can be filled into the appropriate
  attribute here (no checks done!). Otherwise most quantities are computed on
  first access and cached (lazy evaluation). Setters are provided to set values
  with extra checks (e.g. :func:`SetSymmetries`).

  All necessary seq. alignments are done by global BLOSUM62-based alignment. A
  multiple sequence alignment is performed with ClustalW unless
  :attr:`chain_mapping` is provided manually. You will need to have an
  executable ``clustalw`` or ``clustalw2`` in your ``PATH`` or you must set
  :attr:`clustalw_bin` accordingly. Otherwise an exception
  (:class:`ost.settings.FileNotFound`) is thrown.

    Details on algorithms used to find mapping:

    - We try all pairs of chem. mapped chains within symmetry group and get
      superpose-transformation for them
    - First option: check for "sufficient overlap" of other chain-pairs

      - For each chain-pair defined above: apply superposition to full oligomer
        and map chains based on structural overlap
      - Structural overlap = X% of residues in second oligomer covered within Y
        Angstrom of a (chem. mapped) chain in first oligomer. We successively
        try (X,Y) = (80,4), (40,6) and (20,8) to be less and less strict in
        mapping (warning shown for most permissive one).
      - If multiple possible mappings are found, we choose the one which leads
        to the lowest multi-chain-RMSD given the superposition

    - Fallback option: try all mappings to find minimal multi-chain-RMSD
      (warning shown)

      - For each chain-pair defined above: apply superposition, try all (!)
        possible chain mappings (within symmetry group) and keep mapping with
        lowest multi-chain-RMSD
      - Repeat procedure above to resolve symmetry. Within the symmetry group we
        can use the chain mapping computed before and we just need to find which
        symmetry group in first oligomer maps to which in the second one. We
        again try all possible combinations...
      - Limitations:
        
        - Trying all possible mappings is a combinatorial nightmare (factorial).
          We throw an exception if too many combinations (e.g. octomer vs
          octomer with no usable symmetry)
        - The mapping is forced: the "best" mapping will be chosen independently
          of how badly they fit in terms of multi-chain-RMSD
        - As a result, such a forced mapping can lead to a large range of
          resulting QS scores. An extreme example was observed between 1on3.1
          and 3u9r.1, where :attr:`global_score` can range from 0.12 to 0.43

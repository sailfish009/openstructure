Blocks
================================================================================

.. currentmodule:: ost.mol

The most basic type of residue description is the BuildingBlock. It contains
information on atom names and their corresponding types, charges and
optionally also their masses. Interactions for all particles can also
be defined even though they are optional, except the bonds giving
information about the connectivity. 
You often need to manipulate building blocks or
the residues they refer to in an automated manner. That's where the 
BlockModifiers come in, with the GromacsBlockModifier as a specific
implementation. As a special case there also exist HydrogenConstructors.

    for the exact definition of the parameters. A :class:`BuildingBlock`
    gets modified by adding the new atom definitions and also the

.. class:: HeuristicHydrogenConstructor(block)

  As soon as we leave the well defined world of Gromacs residue definitions,
  we have to find new ways for constructing hydrogens. The 
  :class:`HeuristicHydrogenConstructor` takes a :class:`BuildingBlock` at
  initialization and builds heuristic rules to build hydrogens based on 
  the connecticity defined in the given block.

  :param block:         :class:`BuildingBlock` from which the connectivity
                        information for hydrogen construction is extracted
